# Model Notes


This a model from the article:  
**Riluzole-induced block of voltage-gated Na+ current and activation of BKCa channels in cultured differentiated human skeletal muscle cells.**

**Abstract:**   
Riluzole is known to be of therapeutic use in the management of amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis. In this study, we investigated the effects of riluzole on
ion currents in cultured differentiated human skeletal muscle cells (dHSkMCs).
Western blotting revealed the protein expression of alpha-subunits for both
large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (BK(Ca)) channel and Na+ channel
(Na(v)1.5) in these cells. Riluzole could reduce the frequency of spontaneous
beating in dHSkMCs. In whole-cell configuration, riluzole suppressed voltage-
gated Na+ current (I(Na)) in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50
value of 2.3 microM. Riluzole (10 microM) also effectively increased
Ca2+-activated K+ current (I(K(Ca))) which could be reversed by iberiotoxin
(200 nM) and paxilline (1 microM), but not by apamin (200 nM). In inside-out
patches, when applied to the inside of the cell membrane, riluzole (10 microM)
increased BK(Ca)-channel activity with a decrease in mean closed time.
Simulation studies also unraveled that both decreased conductance of I(Na) and
increased conductance of I(K(Ca)) utilized to mimic riluzole actions in
skeletal muscle cells could combine to decrease the amplitude of action
potentials and increase the repolarization of action potentials. Taken
together, inhibition of I(Na) and stimulation of BK(Ca)-channel activity
caused by this drug are partly, if not entirely, responsible for its muscle
relaxant actions in clinical setting.
